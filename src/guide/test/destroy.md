# Destroy

Let's destroy your data!

## Method 1

1. Manually delete your files

    ``` bash
    rm -rf 200/
    ```

2. Verify files are not available

    ``` bash
    ls -lah 200/
    ```

## Method 2

1. Install ransomware of choice. Or download and install from:
  [{{#include ../../includes.md:ransomware-url}}]({{#include ../../includes.md:ransomware-url}})

    > Procuring ransomware can be dangerous, only use trusted sources!

2. Verify that your files are no longer accessible.
