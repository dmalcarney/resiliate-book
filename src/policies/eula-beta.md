        royalty-free, non-transferable, non-assignable license (without
        the right to sublicense):

        i.  to use the Beta Software in accordance with the
            Documentation solely for purposes of internal testing and
            evaluation to determine whether or not to license generally

    2. **Evaluation Feedback**. The purpose of this limited license is

        mutually agreeable to the parties. sāf.ai may use Feedback,
        without restriction in any manner now known or in the future
        conceived, to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly,
        and you hereby grant to sāf.ai a non-exclusive, perpetual,
        irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide right and
        license, with the right to sublicense

        Documentation) or Confidential Information to any third party,
        including but not limited to its partners, affiliates or
        subsidiaries. Except to the extent contrary to any applicable
        laws, Licensee will not, and will not permit any third party to,
        sublicense, rent, copy, modify, create derivative works of,
        translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
        otherwise reduce to human perceivable form any portion of the

        the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not use the Beta
        Software for Licensee's product development or any other
        commercial purpose, including, but not limited to sales or
        marketing activities, except as expressly permitted in this
        Agreement. The Beta Software and all performance data and test
        results, including without limitation, benchmark test results
        (collectively "Performance Data"), relating to the Beta Software
        are the Confidential Information of sāf.ai, and will be treated
        in accordance with the terms of Section 4 of this Agreement.
        Accordingly, Licensee shall not publish or disclose to any third
        party any Performance Data relating to the Beta Software.

        interest in and to the Intellectual Property Rights in the Beta

    5. **No Support Services**. sāf.ai is under no obligation to
        support the Beta Software in any manner or to provide any
        Updates to Licensee. In the event sāf.ai, in its sole
        discretion, supplies any Update to Licensee, the Update shall be
        deemed Beta Software under this Agreement and shall be subject
        to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    6. **Third-Party Software**. The Beta Software may enable a
        computer to run multiple instances of third-party guest
        operating systems and application programs. Licensee

        including guest operating systems and application programs.

        Source Software accompanying the Beta Software. Any such Open
        Source Software is provided under the terms of the applicable
        open source license agreement or copyright notice accompanying
        such Open Source Software or included in the open source
        licenses file accompanying the Beta Software.

3. TERM AND TERMINATION. Unless otherwise terminated as specified under
    this Agreement, Licensee's rights with respect to the Beta Software
    will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the date on which Licensee
    breaches any of the terms of this Beta Agreement, or (ii) 45 day
    automatic expiration of the Beta Software License based on the
    system date. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time
    for any reason or no reason by providing the other party advance
    written notice thereof. Licensee agrees that this Agreement will
    automatically terminate without notice in the event Licensee
    discloses the Beta Software in breach of Section 4 (Confidentiality)
    below. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the
    rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall
    immediately terminate, and Licensee shall immediately cease using,
    and will destroy or render practically inaccessible the Beta
    Software, Documentation, and all other tangible items in Licensee's
    possession or control that contain Confidential Information. The
    rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 2.2,
    2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 survive termination or
    expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

4. CONFIDENTIALITY.

    1. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the Beta Software, all
        information regarding the Beta Software (including any trade
        secrets, know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, and
        algorithms embodied in the Beta Software), Documentation,
        Performance Data, any Updates, sāf.ai products, product
        roadmaps, and other technical, business, financial and product
        development plans, forecasts and strategies, and other
        information provided by sāf.ai to Licensee under this Agreement,
        whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or
        inspection, other than information that Licensee can
        demonstrate:

        (i) was already known to Licensee, other than under an
            obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure;

        (ii) was generally available in the public domain at the time of
             disclosure to Licensee;

        (iii) became generally available in the public domain after
              disclosure other than through any act or omission of
              Licensee;

        (iv) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third
             party without any obligation of confidentiality; *or*

        (v) was independently developed by Licensee without use of or
            reference to any information or materials disclosed by
            sāf.ai or its suppliers.

        If Licensee wishes to disclose to sāf.ai any information under
        this Agreement that Licensee considers proprietary or
        confidential to Licensee ("Licensee Information"), then Licensee
        agrees such disclosure will be governed by a separate
        non-disclosure agreement ("NDA") by and between the parties.

        If Licensee is required to disclose Confidential Information by
        applicable law or court order, Licensee shall notify sāf.ai of
        the required disclosure promptly in writing and shall cooperate
        with sāf.ai in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope
        of the required disclosure. Licensee shall not use any
        Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly
        authorized under this Agreement. In no event shall Licensee use
        the Beta Software or any Confidential Information to develop,
        manufacture, market, sell, or distribute any product or service,
        including any sāf.ai products except as expressly set forth in
        this Agreement. Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential
        Information to any third party. Without limiting the foregoing,
        Licensee shall use at least the same degree of care that it uses
        to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of
        like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to
        prevent the disclosure of such Confidential Information.

    2. Additional Confidentiality Restrictions for Highly Confidential
        Beta Software. For certain Beta Software designated by sāf.ai in
        writing as highly confidential ("Highly Confidential Beta
        Software"), Licensee agrees that the following, additional
        confidentiality obligations and restrictions will apply:

        i. Licensee shall limit dissemination of Highly Confidential
            Beta Software and related information concerning product
            features, future technologies and roadmaps only to
            Information Technology teams and/or software/solutions
            development teams of Licensee approved in writing by sāf.ai,
            and only to individuals on such teams on a need-to-know
            basis and solely for purposes expressly authorized under
            this Agreement. For clarity and without limiting the
            generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not disseminate
            any Highly Confidential Beta Software to Licensee\'s sales
            and marketing field organizations. Licensee will assign an
            employee who will be primarily responsible for ensuring
            Licensee's full compliance with the terms described in this
            Section 4(b) herein.

        ii. Improper Disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software.
            Licensee acknowledges that damages due to Licensee's
            improper disclosure of Highly Confidential Beta Software or
            related information concerning product features, future
            technologies and roadmaps may be irreparable and that
            monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate sāf.ai
            for any breach of this Agreement. In the event that sāf.ai
            reasonably believes that Licensee has disseminated Highly
            Confidential Beta Software or related information concerning
            product features, future technologies and roadmaps to an
            unauthorized party, Licensee will be immediately removed
            from sāf.ai's Beta Software program and will not be
            permitted to participate in any sāf.ai Beta Software program
            in the future. Additionally, all rights and licenses granted
            to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate
            in accordance with Section 3 herein (Term and Termination),
            and (b) in addition to all other remedies available in law
            or otherwise, sāf.ai is entitled to seek equitable relief,
            including injunction and preliminary injunction against the
            threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of
            any such breach.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE
    FOR THE PURPOSES EXPRESSLY PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
    ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUT SUBJECT
    ALWAYS TO THIS SECTION 5, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SĀF.AI AND ITS
    LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT
    EXCEED \$1.00. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
    SHALL SĀF.AI OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
    BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS
    INFORMATION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY
    (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, STATUTE, CONTRACT OR OTHER),
    EVEN IF sāf.ai AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
    REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS DUE
    TO SĀF.AI IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WERE TAKEN
    INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN
    THIS SECTION 5. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THIS LIMITATION IS
    AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT SĀF.AI WOULD NOT
    ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS
    LIABILITY.

6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

    IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE, OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE,
    DOCUMENTATION, AND ANY UPDATES MAY CONTAIN ERRORS AND ARE PROVIDED
    FOR THE PURPOSES EXPRESSLY PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. TO THE
    FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 5, THE BETA
    SOFTWARE, THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION, AND ANY
    UPDATES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
    EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY LAW, AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 5, SĀF.AI AND ITS LICENSORS
    SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Licensee
    acknowledges that sāf.ai may not publicly announced the availability
    of the Beta Software, that such Beta Software may contain features
    currently under development, that sāf.ai has not promised or
    guaranteed to Licensee that such Beta Software will be announced or
    made available to anyone in the future, that sāf.ai has no express
    or implied obligation to Licensee to announce or introduce the Beta
    Software, that sāf.ai may not introduce a product similar to or
    compatible with the Beta Software, and that any version number (if
    any) referenced is subject to change and does not in any way
    represent sāf.ai's commitment to release any product in the future.
    Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that any research or development
    that it performs regarding the Beta Software or any product
    associated with the Beta Software is done entirely at Licensee's own
    risk. Specifically, the Beta Software may contain features,
    functionality or modules that may not be included in the generally
    available commercial version of the Beta Software, if released, or
    that will be marketed separately for additional fees.

            out of or related to this Agreement or the Beta Software

        parties relating to the subject matter hereof and to the fullest
        extent permitted by law, all other terms, representations,
        negotiations, arrangements or understandings are rejected. This
        Agreement supersedes and replaces any other agreements,
        representations, negotiations, arrangements or understandings
        between the parties and Licensee hereby waives any form
        requirements that may be contained in previous agreements and
        agrees that this Agreement shall take precedent with respect to
        its subject matter. No party has entered into this Agreement

        Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
    6. **Waivers**. Any waiver of these terms must be in writing and
        signed by the waiving party to be effective.
    7. **Data Collection and Privacy**.

        i.  **Consent for Collection and Use of Technical Data**. You
            agree that sāf.ai may periodically collect, process and

            files generated in conjunction with a request for support
            services may contain sensitive, confidential or personal
