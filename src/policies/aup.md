# sāf.ai Acceptable Use Policy

## For the paid (including trial) version(s) of sāf.ai software or services

1. This sāf.ai acceptable use policy ("AUP") sets forth certain
    restrictions relating to the access to, and use of, the sāf.ai
    Services by you or someone on your behalf under your agreement with
    sāf.ai applicable to the sāf.ai Services ("Agreement"). The
    restrictions set forth in this AUP are not exhaustive. Any
    capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning
    set forth in the Agreement. This AUP may be updated by sāf.ai from
    time-to-time upon reasonable notice, which may be provided through
    the sāf.ai Services or by posting an updated version of this AUP.
    Updates of the AUP become binding, including on existing users, on
    the later of the date specified in the updated AUP or thirty (30)
    days after posting. Any modification to the AUP within an update
    will relate solely to restrictions on use of, and access to, the
    sāf.ai Services. Any violation of this AUP may result in the
    suspension or termination of your access to and use of the sāf.ai
    Services.
2. You shall not (and shall not permit your Authorized Users to):

    a.  attempt to access, search, or create accounts for any of our
        services by any means other than our publicly supported
        interfaces or as otherwise authorized by us;

    b.  create multiple accounts for the purpose of extending your free
        trial;

    c.  interfere with or disrupt (or attempt to interfere with or
        disrupt) the sāf.ai Services, or gain (or attempt to gain)
        access to any Systems that connect thereto (except as required
        to appropriately access and use the sāf.ai Services);

    d.  use the sāf.ai Services to violate the security or integrity of,
        or otherwise abuse, any System of any party (including without
        limitation the Subscription Services), including but not limited
        to gaining unauthorized access to any System (including
        attempting to probe, scan, monitor, or test the vulnerability of
        a System), forging any headers or other parts of any message
        describing its origin or routing, interfering with the proper
        functioning of any System (including any deliberate attempt by
        any means to overload a System), implementing denial-of-service
        attacks, operating non-permissioned network services (including
        open proxies, mail relays or recursive domain name servers),
        using any means to bypass System usage limitations, or storing,
        transmitting or installing malicious code;

    e.  use the sāf.ai Services to distribute or facilitate the sending
        of unsolicited or unlawful (i) email or other messages, or (ii)
        promotions of any kind;

    f.  use the sāf.ai Services to engage in or promote any other
        fraudulent, deceptive or illegal activities;

    g.  use the sāf.ai Services to process, store or transmit material,
        including any Customer Data, in violation of any Law or any
        third party rights, including without limitation privacy rights;

    h.  disclose to any third party the results of any testing or
        benchmarking of the sāf.ai Services that you might conduct
        unless preapproved by sāf.ai in writing (except to a contractor
        bound to maintain the confidentiality of such information and
        solely for the purposes of supporting your use of the sāf.ai
        Services); or

    i.  use the sāf.ai Services in any circumstances where failure could
        lead to death, personal injury or environmental damage, and you
        further acknowledge that the sāf.ai Services are not designed or
        intended for such use.

### Inactive Monthly Pay as you go (PAYG) accounts:

If an account for which sāf.ai is providing Monthly PAYG Services is
found to be inactive, the account may be suspended or terminated by
sāf.ai, and any Customer Content relating to such account that is stored
within the Subscription Services or other sāf.ai Systems may be deleted.
sāf.ai will provide at least 30 days' notice (in accordance with the
Agreement) prior to permanently deleting your account, unless we deem it
reasonably necessary to suspend or terminate your account without
notice. For the avoidance of doubt, if we determine that the email
associated with your account is invalid (e.g., because it bounces upon
our notification of inactivity), we may terminate your account without
further notice.

An account may be considered inactive if:

- No Customer Authorized User has logged into the account for at least
    six months;
- No Customer Instructional Input was ever created within or input
    into the account and at least three months has passed since the
    account was established; or
- If your account is set up to be paid by credit card, you (i) did not
    provide a valid credit card number or (ii) you failed to update an
    expired or invalid credit card number and at least three months has
    passed without a valid credit card number being on file, provided
    that for the avoidance of doubt this provision does not limit
    sāf.ai\'s right to terminate your account for non-payment relating
    to actual usage.
