# Cyber Security Addendum to Partner Program Agreement

1.  **Purpose and Scope**

    This document defines specific requirements to be fulfilled by each
    partner that sells sāf.ai\'s Products and Services.

    Following the US standards set by NIST 800-\* documents, as well as
    international standard ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and best practices, this
    Cyber Security Addendum document defines globally binding controls
    that cover the partners\'s responsibilities for sāf.ai\'s
    information assets, any assets that the partner may own or has
    access to by the Partner, or by any down-stream or adjacent
    suppliers to the Partner.

    Thus, the purpose of this document is the definition of specific
    controls that must be implemented and a consistent and effective
    approach for appropriately protecting sāf.ai\'s information assets,
    saf.ai\'s ultimate end-users\' information assets and any data or
    information asset that lie within the purview or adjacent to that
    supply-chain e.g. access by unauthorized persons, loss or
    non-availability, manipulation or falsification.

    The Cyber Security Addendum provides a reusable set of security and
    compliance requirements that have to be provided to all external
    partners, suppliers, and contractors having access to or managing
    sāf.ai\'s information assets, as well as downstream supply-chain
    assets, and as such pose information security and reputation risk to
    sāf.ai.

    For reference, Contractor as referenced herein may be known as
    Consultant, Supplier, Partner, or Vendor in the Agreement.

2.  **Security Overview**.

    For any Task Order or Statement of Work in which Contractor is
    providing Service(s), Contractor will provide a secure environment
    for any and all hardware and software (including servers, network,
    and data components) to be provided or used by Contractor as part of
    its performance under this Agreement.

    Contractor represents that the security measure it takes in
    performance of its obligations under this Agreement are, and will at
    all times:

    i.  have implemented the \"moderate\" impact controls of National
        Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 security
        requirements;
    ii. the security requirements, obligations, specifications, and
        event reporting procedures set forth in this Addendum of the
        Agreement; or

    iii\. any security requirements, obligations, specifications,

    :   and/or event reporting procedures set forth in the applicable
        Task Order or Statement of Work. Failure of Contractor to comply
        with the security requirements hereunder shall constitute a
        breach of the Agreement.

    during the term of this Agreement will at all times enforce an
