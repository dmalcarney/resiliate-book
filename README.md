# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is used to

## Basic Syntax

### Headers

In Markdown, you use the `#` symbol to create a heading. The number of `#` symbols you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (`<h3>`), you'd use three `#` symbols.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis

You can make text bold or italic.

- Bold: `**bold text**`
- Italic: `*italicized text*`

### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

- Unordered Lists: You can use `*`, `-`, or `+` to create an unordered list.

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

- Ordered Lists: You can create an ordered list by using numbers:

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

### Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`.

```markdown
[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)
```

### Images

You can use the following syntax to create an image:

```markdown
![alt text](image.jpg)
```

### Code Blocks

You can create a code block by wrapping your code in triple backticks.

<code>
```markdown
This is a code block
```
</code>

## Basic HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and it consists of a series of elements.

### Basic Elements

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings. `<h1>` defines the most important heading and `<h6>` defines the least important heading.
- `<p>`: Define a paragraph.
- `<a>`: Define a hyperlink.
- `<img>`: Define an image.
- `<ul>`: Define an unordered list.
- `<ol>`: Define an ordered list.
- `<li>`: Define a list item.

Here's a basic example of HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ul>

</body>
</html>
```

Remember, while Markdown files (.md) support HTML, it's best to use Markdown syntax whenever possible for simplicity and readability.
